Notational Velocity
===================

The recommended setup for working with PKB initially is the Notational Velocity ecosystem: [nvALT](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/) on OS X, [Notation](http://getnotation.com/) on Windows, and [Simple Note](http://simplenote.com/) on mobile. nvALT should be set up to use plain text files in a directory. Then PKB can be pointed at this directory to work with your existing notes.
